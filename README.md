*ENED 1120 - Project 4*

This file contains the code that our team used for the final demonstration. 
We successfully passed the subtasks and made it to the final track. 
Unfortunately, our map of the containers was configured incorrectly, so we did not score any points during the full track.

## Contents

This repository contains all of our team's code for the Project 4. 
The code is this repository was written by three users, so the style and documentation of the program will likely be inconsistent across users. 

You will see that the code is divided into two folders: PastCode and SupportingScripts. 

### 1. PastCode

Contains the code that was not used in the final demonstration, but may have had use in previous versions. 

This may include early subtasks, the mid project review, and out-dated scripts/functions.

### 2. SupportingScripts

Contains code that is used for the final demonstration. 
This includes subtask code, full track code, global variables, and working functions.
